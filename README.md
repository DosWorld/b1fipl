# A Bestiary of Single-File Implementations of Programming Languages

## Introduction

Programming languages are amazing pieces of work. They turn our words, numbers, and symbols into the bits that make a machine do things.

It's easy to get overwhelmed when implementing a programming language. The GNU Compiler Collection is [millions of lines long](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTE1OTg).

That's too complicated to learn how to implement a programming language. Luckily, some smart people have distilled the most interesting parts of programming languages into an approachable essence. I'm referring to implementations of programming languages that fit in a single source code file. 

These single-file implementations are rarely complete, hardly sophisticated or efficient. But they are concise, clear, and easy to understand, letting you discover why programming languages are amazing.
