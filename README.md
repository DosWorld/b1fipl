# A Bestiary of Single-File Implementations of Programming Languages

## Introduction

Programming languages are amazing pieces of work. They turn our words, numbers, and symbols into the bits that make a machine do things.

It's easy to get overwhelmed when implementing a programming language. The GNU Compiler Collection is [millions of lines long](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTE1OTg).

That's too complicated to learn how to implement a programming language. Luckily, some smart people have distilled the most interesting parts of programming languages into an approachable essence. I'm referring to implementations of programming languages that fit in a single source code file. 

These single-file implementations are rarely complete, hardly sophisticated or efficient. But they are concise, clear, and easy to understand, letting you discover why programming languages are amazing.

## The Bestiary

[7 lines of code, 3 minutes](http://matt.might.net/articles/implementing-a-programming-language/) implemented by Matt Might

[arpilisp](https://github.com/marcpaq/arpilisp) implemented by Marc Paquette

[Brainfuck](http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/bf.asm.txt) implemented by Brian Raiter

[How to implement a programming language in JavaScript](http://lisperator.net/pltut/) implemented by Mihai Bazon

[(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))](http://www.norvig.com/lispy.html) implemented by Peter Norvig

[jonesForth](https://github.com/nornagon/jonesforth/blob/master/jonesforth.S) implemented by Richard W.M. Jones

[Lisp In Less Than 200 Lines Of C](https://carld.github.io/2017/06/20/lisp-in-less-than-200-lines-of-c.html) implemented by Carl Douglas

[Pascal-S](http://standardpascal.org/pascals.html) implemented by Niklaus Wirth & Scott A. Moore

[The Super Tiny Compiler!](https://github.com/thejameskyle/the-super-tiny-compiler) implemented by James Kyle

[Tiny Basic](http://ittybittycomputers.com/IttyBitty/TinyBasic/index.htm) implemented by Tom Pittman

## Honourable Mention

[An Implementation of J](http://www.jsoftware.com/books/pdf/aioj.pdf) implemented by Arthur Whitney. See the appendix "Incunabulum". It's only a fragment of the J interpreter, but its conciseness is impressive.


## Epilogue

Have you implemented a programming language in a single file? Let me know with a pull request.
