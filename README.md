# A Bestiary of Single-File Implementations of Programming Languages

## Introduction

Programming languages are amazing pieces of work. They turn our words, numbers, and symbols into the bits that make a machine do things.

It's easy to get overwhelmed when implementing a programming language. The GNU Compiler Collection is [millions of lines long](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTE1OTg).

That's too complicated to learn how to implement a programming language. Luckily, some smart people have distilled the most interesting parts of programming languages into an approachable essence. I'm referring to implementations of programming languages that fit in a single source code file. 

These single-file implementations are rarely complete, hardly sophisticated or efficient. But they are concise, clear, and easy to understand, letting you discover why programming languages are amazing.

## The Bestiary

[7 lines of code, 3 minutes](http://matt.might.net/articles/implementing-a-programming-language/) implemented by Matt Might.

[arpilisp](https://github.com/marcpaq/arpilisp) implemented by Marc Paquette.

[asm6502.py](http://www.dabeaz.com/superboard/asm6502.py) implemented by David Beazley.

[Brainfuck](http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/bf.asm.txt) implemented by Brian Raiter.

[How to implement a programming language in JavaScript](http://lisperator.net/pltut/) implemented by Mihai Bazon.

[(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))](http://www.norvig.com/lispy.html) implemented by Peter Norvig.

[jonesForth](https://github.com/nornagon/jonesforth/blob/master/jonesforth.S) implemented by Richard W.M. Jones.

[Lisp In Less Than 200 Lines Of C](https://carld.github.io/2017/06/20/lisp-in-less-than-200-lines-of-c.html) implemented by Carl Douglas.

[Mini-Scheme](https://github.com/catseye/minischeme) updated by Chris Pressey, originally implemented by Atsushi Moriwaki.

[Pascal-S](http://standardpascal.org/pascals.html) implemented by Niklaus Wirth & Scott A. Moore.

[A Regular Expression Matcher](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/beautiful.html) implemented by Rob Pike, exegesis by Brian Kernighan.

[The Super Tiny Compiler!](https://github.com/thejameskyle/the-super-tiny-compiler) implemented by James Kyle.

[Tiny Basic](http://ittybittycomputers.com/IttyBitty/TinyBasic/index.htm) implemented by Tom Pittman.

[Tutorial - Write a Shell in C](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/) implemented by Stephen Brennan.

[VTL02 for 6502](https://github.com/Klaus2m5/VTL02) ported and improved by Mike Barry. VTL-02 was originally designed and implemented by [Gary Shannon & Frank McCoy](http://www.altair680kit.com/manuals/Altair_680-VTL-2%20Manual-05-Beta_1-Searchable.pdf).

## Honourable Mention

[An Implementation of J](http://www.jsoftware.com/books/pdf/aioj.pdf) implemented by Arthur Whitney. See the appendix "Incunabulum". It's only a fragment of the J interpreter, but its conciseness is impressive.


## Epilogue

Have you implemented a programming language in a single file? Let me know with a pull request.
